 * The home for all engine abstractions; if you add a new account type or engine
 * then this is ideally the only place it gets added.  Some changes may happen
 * in the future to define these all as optional extensions that the app_logic
 * gets to decide on.  This module provides a means of requiring/loading the
 * givenengine modules on demand, as well as providing metadata about engines.
 *
 * Currently we use two type of identifiers:
 * - Account Type Strings (old, but not going away):
 *   - imap+smtp
 *   - pop3+smtp
 *   - activesync
 * - Engine Id Strings (new):
 *   - gmailImap
 *   - vanillaImap
 *   - activesync
 *   - pop3
 *
 * ## Note: Disabled Account Types
 * - ActiveSync is disabled because some UMD stuff in its codepages.js was
 *   breaking the build with `the request of a dependency is an expression` and
 *   the reality is that there is no situation where it will ever be a supported
 *   account type ever again unless magic funding appears with that string
 *   attached.
